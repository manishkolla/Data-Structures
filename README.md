# Data-Structures-in Python
Algorithms related to searching, sorting and Stacks, Queues, hashmaps, trees, and graphs

**Unit 1: Prerequisite Review**
briefly reviewing key concepts from mathematics (mainly logarithms) and computer science (namely, basic coding and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming).

**Unit 2: Asymptotic Analysis** 
analyinge how fast an algorithm is and how much space it uses up. We will discuss how computer scientists formally analyze performance, and use this to develop a number of classes of more performant and less performant algorithms. 

**Unit 3: Arrays and Linked List**
Exploring and reviewing the two base data structures for exploring linear information. as

**Unit 4: Searching and Sorting**
Exploring the well-studied problem of searching through and sorting a list. We will delve into some more intuitive but less performant sorting algorithms first, then work our way into more performant algorithms. As part of this unit, we will deep-dive into recursion. 

**Unit 5: Lists, Stacks and Queues**
exploring the most common ways to store linear data, including lists, stacks, and  queues; we will also explore the operations that are commonly associated to these problems.

**Unit 6: General Trees, Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Self Balancing Trees, and Heaps**
exploring our first nonlinear data structure the Tree. During this exploration we will cover, general trees, binary trees, binary search trees, and heaps; we will also explore the operations that are commonly associated to these problems.

**Unit 7: Graphs**
we will explore our second nonlinear data structure the Graph. During this exploration we will cover, directed, undirected, and weighted; we will also explore the operations that are commonly associated to these problems

**Unit 8: Maps**
we will deep-dive into sets and maps, and explore how the concept of hashing makes sets and maps run quickly.
